Practice: Contact List
Build four components:

1. A ContactCollection component that loads existing contacts from storage, and saves new ones. Each new contact should have an auto-generated identifier.
2. A Contact component that displays a person's name, phone number, and address.
3. A ContactList component that displays all contacts. It should import the Contact component and the ContactCollection component.
4. A ContactForm component that, when filled out and a submit button is pressed, adds a new contact to storage. It should import the ContactCollection component.
In main.js, import the ContactList component and the ContactForm component.

The user should see the contact form at the top of the view, and the list of contacts underneath it.

Bonus: Are there any other modules that could be made? Do any modules have more than one possible responsibility? Perhaps something that is a general utility function.

`<div class="form-post">
    <p class="entry_text">Have a date but can't think of anything?</p>
    <button  id="btn" class="btn itinerary__save">Submit Your Date Idea</button>
</div>`
